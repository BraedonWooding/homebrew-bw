# homebrew-bw
Since a lot of the stuff I build is semi-unknown and is annoying to get Homebrew authentication I just made my own tap :).

## Install

`homebrew tap BraedonWooding/bw`, after this you can install any of the following really easily!

## Currently Supported Packages

- [notes](https://github.com/BraedonWooding/notes), install like `brew install notes --HEAD`.
  - In 'alpha' stage so be warned.  Currently you also need to create `mkdir ~/my_notes` until I can see if either homebrew can create that or I get around to supporting multiple locations (and in that case having no locations will just ask to create one).
